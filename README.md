### Supply Chain Data Analytics Project

The supply chain dataset comprises 20 columns and 8000+ rows, containing information on various aspects of the supply chain, 
including product details, pricing, availability, sales, manufacturing, shipping, and costs. It is designed for analyzing revenue generation, 
manufacturing expenses, and transportation costs to optimize supply chain operations.

### Problem Statement

The supply chain dataset presents a comprehensive set of information related to product sales, 
manufacturing, profits, and logistics. The challenge is to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from the data to 
optimize supply chain operations and improve profitability.

MySQL Analysis:-
----------------

I utilized MySQL to analyze supply chain data and answer specific questions.

üìä Total Revenue by Product Type:
Calculate the total revenue generated by each product type. This can help identify the most profitable products.

üöö Shipping Costs by Carrier(Airways,Railways,Seaways):
Calculate the average shipping costs for each shipping carrier to evaluate which carrier is the most cost-effective.

‚è≥ Lead Times by Supplier(working on it):
Calculate average lead times for each supplier to assess their reliability in delivering products on time.

üåç Total Products Sold by Location:
Determine the total number of products sold in each location to understand regional demand.

üîç Defect Rates by Inspection Results:
Calculate defect rates for different inspection results to assess product quality.

üí∞ Ranking Products by Profitability:
Write a query to rank products based on profitability, where profitability is calculated as (revenue generated - manufacturing costs - shipping costs).

üì¶ Supplier Performance Analysis:
Calculate the average lead time for each supplier and identify suppliers with lead times higher than the overall average.

üèÜ Top 5 Shipping Carriers by Cost Efficiency:
Determine the top 5 shipping carriers with the lowest average shipping costs per product shipped.



### MS Excel Analysis (Crrently Working on it):-
----------------
![Excel](...)

Excel Analysis Summary for Supply Chain Capstone Project:

Create an Excel dashboard for your supply chain capstone project and visualize key insights from your supply chain dataset.



### üìä Visualizing Key Insights ( Working and Implementing on it)....

From the overall analysis, I have discovered some key insights which i am working on :

üí∞ Diversified Category of products are the most profitable, generating significant revenue. Haircare products come next in popularity, followed by cosmetics.

üöö Carrier (Airways, ARailways and Seaways) has the highest shipping costs on average, with appropriate carrierr, to identify the most affordable carrier based on the requirements for Shipping of goods.

üõ≥Ô∏è Among the four transportation modes (air, rail, and sea), air transportation is associated with higher shipping costs, while sea transportation offers a more economical solution.

üìà The top locations for product sales are East America States and North East states , closely followed by some states, each with a substantial number of products sold. In contrast, reports the lowest number of products sold.

‚ùå Among the three types of products, low office supplies products exhibits the highest defect rate at 37%, followed by other products.

üíº The manufacturing cost of _______ products is higher than that of ________ and __________ .

This Excel dashboard i am working on provides a concise overview of the supply chain dataset, making it easier to understand and make data-driven decisions.


Tableau Desktop and Alteyrx:-
-----------

![Tableau Desktop - Dashboard](......)

In Tableau Desktop, build charts, graphs, and KPIs to visualize the data and understand it more interactively, along with 
that, build some slicers to make it more user-friendly to customize the charts and graphs.

Build some Worksheet, Dashboard and Story Points to understand some key performance indicators, including:

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) i am working on :

1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Revenue: ___________

2Ô∏è‚É£ Average Product Price: ________

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total Products Sales: ____________

4Ô∏è‚É£ Manufacturing Cost: _____________

5Ô∏è‚É£ Total Available Products: ___________

6Ô∏è‚É£ Total Stock(SKU) Value: _____________



### Charts and Graphs i am working on currently to identify more better insights on some metrics and mesaures:

1. Average Defect Rate, Manufacturing Lead Time, and Manufacturing Cost by Product

2. Customer Demographics vs. Number of Products Sold by Product Type

3. Total Revenue Generated by Product Type and Total Products Sold by Product Type

4. Average Manufacturing Cost vs. Average Price by Product Type

5. Transportation Modes vs. Routes with Average Cost

6. Defect Rate vs. Inspection Rate by Product Type

7. Transportation Modes and Shipping Carriers with Average Shipping Time



### Interactive Parameters and Charts(slicers):

1) Product Category Type

2) Transportation Mode

3) Shipping Carrier

4) Region


## Insights
1. The highest number of products sold among the three product categories is products, which accounts for __% of the business. Haircare follows at __%, and cosmetics contribute __% to the revenue.

2. Analyzing customer demographics versus the number of products sold by product type reveals that the female group purchases higher-quality products, while the male group opts for products of roughly equal quality in terms of ____ and ___. 

A  Identifying group category purchases a higher quantity of all three product types. products are the most popular among all four product categories, indicating a high demand.

3. Analyzing product availability and stock levels shows that the company maintains an equal quantity of inventory for haircare and skincare products, with slightly less stock for products ______.
________ products exhibit higher availability and lower stock levels, enabling quick manufacturing and shipment. 

In contrast, _____ and _______ have higher stock levels and lower availability, meaning the company faces challenges in promptly shipping these products due to longer manufacturing times.

4. ____________ products have higher order quantities and longer lead times, often associated with higher production volumes. 


Higher production volumes necessitate longer lead times to ensure adequate time for manufacturing products to meet customer demand.

 _________ products also exhibit longer lead times and higher production volumes, possibly due to the need for more specialized ingredients or manufacturing processes.

5. All product categories show a higher defect rate.

6. An analysis of revenue generated by shipping carriers indicates that shipping carrier B is costlier but generates higher revenue.

7. According to the graph, the fastest and most efficient shipping option is Carrier B, and the most efficient transportation mode is road in all four transportation modes.
